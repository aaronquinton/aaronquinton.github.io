Details for this project and the deployed shiny application can be found at the linked [Github Repository](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/mental-health-analysis-and-app)  

In this project, my classmate Fan Nie and I were challenged with developing a shiny application in R which upholding strong visualization principles. The data set we chose to build an interactive visualization for was 2014 survey results on attitudes towards mental health in the technology industry. The survey data was primarily categorical which offered an interesting challenge when deciding how to best visualize the important aspects. For more information visit the README document in the linked repository above.
