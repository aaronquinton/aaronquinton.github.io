I completed this project with my classmate Sayanti Ghosh as part of the UBC Master of Data Science program. The purpose of this project was to develop our data science work flow practices. With this objective in mind we focused our efforts on predicting the country medal count for the 2020 Summer Olympics.  

To ensure reproducibility we thoroughly documented our work on Github. Our repository for this project can be found [here.](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_OlympicMedalPrediction)  

We made use of `Makefile` to run our analysis via the command line. We also utilized `docker` so that the analysis can be run without installing any additional software. For more details check out the README on the repository linked above.
