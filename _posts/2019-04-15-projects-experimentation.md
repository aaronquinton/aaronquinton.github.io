Details for this project are found in the Github Repository [Running Late](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/running_late)

In this project my teammates (Alycia Butterworth, Sreya Guha, and Fan Nie) and I conducted a survey with fellow classmates investigating the relationship between commute time and how late students are coming to class. Our analysis used a hurdle model and linear regression to account for the zero inflated data and confounding variables respectively.
