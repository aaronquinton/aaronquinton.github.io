Details for this project are found in two Github repositories:  
Python Package |[LibRely-Py-](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/LibRely-Py-)  
R Package |[LibRely-R-](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/LibRely-R-)  

This project focused on developing best practices for R and Python software development. Myself, and my team mates, Alex Hope and Bonnie Zhang, created R and Python packages to perform a meta analysis of R and Python scripts respectively. The primary focus of this project was as an exercise of software development best practices. As such, the functionality of each package is limited. In this project we utilized black box and white box testing for 100% branch coverage, appropriate exception handling, and continuous integration.
