The Masters of Data Science program concludes with a two month capstone project where the students work with an industry partner to solve a proposed problem. For this project my teammates (Ayla Pearson, and Fan Nie) and I partnered with BC Stats to analyze their 2018 Work Environment Survey. We utilized natural language processing techniques to automate the multi-label text classification of open ended survey responses. Additionally, we conducted a mixed method analysis to connect the quantitative and qualitative survey data to support future survey design.

Details for this project are made publicly available in the Github Repository [mds_capstone_bcstats](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/mds_capstone_bcstats)
