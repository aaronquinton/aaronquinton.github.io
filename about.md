Hi there! My name is Aaron Quinton and I recently graduated the Masters of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. I have experience working as an engineer in the oil and gas industry as part of the Financial Advisory team at Deloitte. I love working with numbers and strive to add value and efficiencies to day to day activities and business with the help of data. I am always eager to tackle problems, learn, and teach.
